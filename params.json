Please feel free (and encouraged) to [open GitHub issues](https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap/issues/new), email me directly, reach out [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/scottbez1), and [get involved](https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap/pulls) in the open source development and let's keep chatting and building together!\r\n\r\n### Design Highlights ###\r\n* laser cut enclosure and mechanisms from a single material\r\n* cheap, widely available 28byj-48 stepper motor (less expensive than NEMA-17 motors, and doesn't require an expensive high current stepper driver)\r\n* CR80 PVC cards for flaps, cheap in bulk\r\n* store-bought vinyl stickers for flap letters\r\n\r\n## License ##\r\nThe vast majority of this project is licensed under Apache v2 (see [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) for full details).\r\n\r\n    Copyright 2015 Scott Bezek\r\n    \r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n    \r\n        http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n    \r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n",
