# DIY Split-Flap Display

This is a work in progress DIY [split-flap display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-flap_display).

![animated rendering](renders/animation.gif)

The goal is to make a low-cost display that's easy to fabricate at home (e.g. custom materials can be ordered from Ponoko or similar, and other hardware is generally available).

### Design highlights ###
* laser cut MDF enclosure and mechanisms (material thickness is parameterized, so design can be adjusted to accomodate different materials)
* cheap, widely available 28byj-48 stepper motor (less expensive than NEMA-17 motors, and doesn't require an expensive high current stepper driver)
* CR80 PVC cards for flaps, cheap in bulk (still need to figure out fabrication of these, or switch to laser-cut plastic...)
* vinyl stickers for flap letters?

### TODO ###
* Enclosure
    * top
    * bottom
    * back
    * captive nut connectors
    * holes in right side for adjacent unit's motor/bolts
* Fabrication
    * 2d projection and panelizing for laser cutter
